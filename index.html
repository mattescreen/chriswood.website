				<h2>matte_screen: VDR </br>
				&#91;Vibratory Decreation Ritual&#93; (2019-20)</h2>
				<img src="media/SENTICS_qualities2.png" height="50%" width="50%" style="align-self: center">
				<div class="description-text">
				<p> At the unending advent of expanding digital processing power and a limited understanding of emotional processing methods, how can we create and hold physical social space in a way that is necessarily physical and social? How can we reclaim performance as a ritual space; a space to converge with our common experiences, reflect, and make new meanings together?
				</p>
				<p>
				Via their Vibratory Decreation Ritual (VDR), matte_screen seeks to re-assess, re-negotiate, and re-embody the complex potential of screen-based emotional experience. 
				<p>
				The ritual is rooted in the mission that our emotions are seated physically as biological scripts in the body, in relationship to gravity, and dependent on external stimuli to be felt. We need to attune these scripts: attune them in response to the compound qualities and environments of screen-based experience, attune them together so that we may learn from each other.
				</p>
				<p>
				In VDR m_s undergoes their invented process of machine-mirror-learning via their VDR_container: the body (personal and collective) is the object of encoding, undergoing a practice of integrating internet-derived-stimulus through the activation of space (physical sound) and body (physical movement).  
				</p>
				<p>
				matte_screen: VDR will be performed as part of the Emotional AI Symposium March 27-29 2020 at ZKM Karlsruhe. The ritual was developed during the residency "Emotional Artificial Intelligence" by the ZKM | Hertz-Lab at the ZKM | Center for Art and Media, Karlsruhe. This project takes place within the framework of the INTERFACES project with the support of the Creative Europe funding programme of the European Union.

					<h4>6 hour performance-installation

					<p>How are bodies socially situated within a structured space generated by the vibrations of sound (or lack there of)?
						</br>
					How does computer-based introversion effect human sociality?
						</br>
					Social Structure 1 explores how human sociality changes in two contrasting situations: computer-based introversion and direct physical connection. 
					The performer stands alone with eyes closed, connected to their computer through an ungrounded copper strip for 6 hours. Their ungrounded bodily signal is amplified, connects with their computer, and signals an audiovisual atmosphere in the space - composed from recordings of their personal computer activities.
					In front of the performer is another copper strip, connected to ground the performer's signal. A Sign asks "connect with me?" asking that any spectator stands on the strip and holds the hands of the performer - thus shorting the performer's signal / computer life, provoking audial/visual silence, and creating a directly focused social interaction.

					<h4>installation for reverse-polarity speakers and suspended microphones in motion
						</br>Ensemble Room, Mills College - Oakland, CA - November 2016</h4>
					<p>recovery is a sound installation providing a space for discovery and a deeper understanding of the physical/ social properties of sound. by directing sound through two speakers facing each other with inverse phases - the resulting inverse vibrations 'cancel' and modulate each other, resulting in a volatile plane of deterioration and modulation between them. outside of this plane, we hear significantly less of the original sound source, but in the plane between speakers the phenomenon of phase cancellation is neatly retained.
					</br>
					two microphones are suspended and activated as pendulums within this plane, capturing the physical inconsistancies of the sound and recomposing them through a surround sound system - also creating varied standing wave phenomena throughout the space. through this simple structure the spectator directly sees how the movements of the microphones capture different vibrations in the air and experiences different sonorities walking through the space - giving them a unique opportunity to (re)discover the physical proporties of sound in a personalized meditative experience

					<p>Chris Wood’s art crosses and combines the mediums of sound, theater, dance, text, projections, and social practice. In performance he combines physical and emotional experience with movement, theater, and custom analog and digital electronics to create situations of emotional and social renegotiation. His work asks questions like: How do the vibrations of sound effect our social situation? What effects does screen-based sociality have on our physical presence and community awareness?</p>
					<p>Chris Wood received an MFA in Electronic Music and Recording Media at Mills College. He resides in Chicago, where he co-founded and continues to perform/curate/create with Mocrep, a collective creating radically experimental, interdisciplinary, and collaborative work. He's held residencies at ZKM Hertz-Lab and ACRE. He’s studied with Laetitia Sonami, Pauline Oliveros, Fred Frith, James Fei, Maggi Payne, and Zeena Parkins. He’s performed and shown work in Chicago, NYC, San Diego, Oakland, Stanford, Toronto, Berlin, Munich, Darmstadt, Tashkent, and Graz.
